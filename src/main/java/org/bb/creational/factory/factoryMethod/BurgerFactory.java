package org.bb.creational.factory.factoryMethod;

/*
Suitable for single product hierarchies where you want to delegate the instantiation to subclasses.

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
Use Cases:
Single Product Type with Variants:
    When your system requires a single type of product but allows different variations of that product. For example, different types of burgers (ChickenBurger, VeggieBurger) in a burger restaurant.

Simpler Object Creation:
    When object creation is straightforward and doesnâ€™t require multiple related objects.

Subclasses Decide Object Creation:
    When you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation to subclasses.
